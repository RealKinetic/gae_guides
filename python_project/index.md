A GAE Python Project
====================


While Google has a decent amount of documentation for Google App Engine and the standard getting started guides and tutorials there isn't much material out there on setting up a proper, production ready GAE project. This post is a walk-through of laying out how we structure our Python based Google App Engine - Standard projects. This includes packaging dependencies for deployment as well as ensuring libraries are accessible in the local environment and tests. 

A note this guide focus on Python 2.7 on the GAE standard environment. In future posts we hope to show how to use other languages on the Flexible environment.
